cloud computing is the on demand delivery to compute power,database storage,application,I and other IT resources.

Provision of right type and size of computing resources you need

access as many resources instantly

AWs own a network connecred hardware required for these application services.

eg:GMAIL(email cloud service),DROPBOX(Cloud storage Device),NETFLIX(Video on Demand)

DEPLOYMENT MODELS OF THE CLOUD

Private CLoud

Cloud services used by single organisation,not exposed to public

Complete Control

Security of sensitive applications

8. What is Cloud Computing?
Public Cloud

Famous eg are Google Cloud,AWS.

Owned and operated by 3rd party cloud service

Hybrid Cloud(

Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud

Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure

Flexibility and cost effectiveness of public cloud

9. The Different Types of Cloud Computing
Types Of Cloud Computing

On premises:Application,Data,Runtime,Middleware,O/S,Virtualization,Servers,Storage,Networking

Infrastructure as a Service:(App , Data,Runtime,Middleware,O/S)

Amazon EC2 on AWS

GCP,Azure,Rackspace

Platform As a Service: Application,Data

Elastic Beanstalk

Google App Engine(GCP),Windows Azure(MICROSOFT)

Software As a Service: Everything is managed by AWS

Many AWS services(Rekognition for Machine Learning)

GMAIL,ZOOM

Pricing of the Cloud

Compute: Pay for compute time

Storage : Pay for data stored out of cloud

Data transfer OUT of the Cloud :Data transfer IN is Free

10. AWS Cloud Overview
Choosing AWS region

PROXIMITY : close to users

COMPLIANCE: DATA governance, legal req

PRICING : pricing varies region to region

AVAILABLE SERVICES : new services and new features aren't available

AWS Availability zones

MAX-6 , Min-2 , usually 3

They have high bandwidth

isolated from each other

each zone has redundant power, networking and connectivity

4. IAM - Identity and Access Management
29. IAM Security Tools
IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT(IAM) SECURITY TOOLS

IAM CREDENTIALS REPORT(ACCOUNT LEVEL)

A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.

IAM ACCESS ADVISOR(USER-LEVEL)

Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user when those services were last accessed

You can use this information to revise your policies.

IAM POLICIES

When attached to a policy, defines their permissions

Customers are responsible for defining and using IAM Polices

The AWS CLI can interact with the AWS using command line shell whereas AWS SDK can interact AWS  programmatically.

5. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
37. EC2 Instance Types Basics
ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD



EC2 INSTANCE TYPES(COMPUTE OPTIMIZED) eg:CGg,C6gn,CS,C5a,C5n,C4

Batch processing workloads

Media transcoding

High performance web servers

High performance computing

Scientific modeling and machine learning

Dedicated gaming servers

EC2 INSTANCE TYPES(MEMORY OPTIMIZED)  eg: RGg, RS,RSa,RSb,RSn,R4,X1e,X1

Fast performance

Use cases:

High performance, Relational / non-relational databases

In memory databases optimized for BI

applications performing real time  processing for big  unstructured data

EC2 INSTANCE TYPES(STORAGE OPTIMIZED)

Great for storage access that requires high sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.

High frequency online transactions

Relational and NOSQL databases

Data warehousing applications

Distributed file systems

5. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
35. EC2 Basics
EC2(ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD) = INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE

It consists in the capability of

Renting virtual machines(EC2)

Storing data on virtual drives(EBS)

Distributing load across machines

Scaling the services using an autoscaling app(ASG)

5. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
38. Security Groups & Classic Ports Overview
SECURITY GROUPS

INBOUND

OUTBOUND

can be attached to multiple instances

locked down to region/VPC combination

lives outside the EC2

good to maintain on seperate security group for SSH access



if the security group is authorised and connected to another security group EC@ instance can be accessed

CLassic ports

22-ssh=secure shell(login to a linux instance)

21-ftp=file transfer protocol (upload files to a file share)

22-sftp=secure file transfer protocol(upload files using SSH)

80-http:hyper text transfer protocol(access unsecured websites)

443-https:access secured websites

5. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
47. EC2 Instance Purchasing Options
EC2 Capacity Reservations

Reserve On-Demand instance capacity

You always have access to EC2

No time commitment, no billing discounts

Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and saving plans to benefit from billing discounts

You are chardged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not

6. EC2 Instance Storage
50. EBS Overview
EBS(ELASTIC BLOCK STORE)VOLUME is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.

It uses the network to communicate the instance

It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another quickly

Its locked to an availbility zone(AZ)

have a provisioned capacity(get billed for the capacity)

allows instances to persist data even after termination

can only run one instance at a time

bound to sez
